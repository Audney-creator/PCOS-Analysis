# PCOS-Analysis
This was one of my favorite Excel projects so far!
I analyzed data on Polycystic Ovary Syndrome(PCOS) — a hormonal disorder common among women — to uncover trends and insights related to age, BMI, hormone levels, and menstrual irregularities.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes data related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using Microsoft Excel.
The goal was to uncover patterns and relationships between factors such as age, BMI, hormonal levels, and menstrual irregularities — all visualized in a clear, easy-to-read Excel dashboard.

## Tools & Techniques Used 
### Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Pivot Charts
- Data Cleaning 
- Conditional Formatting

## Project Objectives
- Explore how PCOS diagnosis varies across different age categories.
- Examine the impact of BMI on PCOS occurrence.
- Identify how hormonal and menstrual factors contribute to PCOS diagnosis.
- Design an interactive Excel dashboard that presents the findings visually.

## Data
### Dataset Description
The dataset contains health and demographic data of women categorized by age, BMI, and diagnostic indicators.
Key variables include:
- Age Category (Teenager, Middle Age, Young Adult, etc.)
- BMI
- Testosterone Level
- Antral Follicle Count
- Menstrual Irregularity
- PCOS Diagnosis Status
### Data Source 
This Dataset was gotten from Kaggle.

## Key Insights

- The participants were grouped into four age phases:
  1. Teenagers (≤19 years)
  2. Young Adults (20–29 years)
  3. Middle Age (30–39 years)
  4. Older Ladies (40 years and above)

- The Young Adult group recorded the highest number of participants, indicating that most respondents were within their reproductive years.
- PCOS diagnosis was most common among young adults and middle-aged women, suggesting that hormonal imbalances and lifestyle factors may become more pronounced during these stages.
- Teenagers had relatively fewer diagnoses, possibly due to late detection or milder symptoms at that age.
- Contrary to general expectations, BMI did not appear to influence PCOS occurrence in this dataset — most participants had normal BMI values, whether diagnosed or not.
- Hormonal indicators (like testosterone levels) were generally higher among diagnosed participants.
- **Menstrual irregularity** was observed in all diagnosed cases, making it a strong associated symptom in the dataset.
